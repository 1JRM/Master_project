# Master project

Welcome to the repository of the master thesis of engineering student Jacob R. Mortensen.
This project is a total of 30 ECTS. The topic is mineralisation of nitrogen in biogas reaction, including substrate analysis and methane potentials. The project also verifies the gravimetric density method presented by Justesen et al, 2019.
The project is split in 3 main experiments. Mineralisation is studied in batch and continuous reactors using a mobile nylon bag technique used in the Department of Animal Science at Aarhus University. 

This repository contains everything used in the master project of Jacob R. Mortensen, au518747 at Aarhus University. Everything in this project is open and will later be shared at the webpage of Aarhus University.

For any question, please contact Jacob R. Mortensen at jacob.rosholm.mortensen@post.au.dk
